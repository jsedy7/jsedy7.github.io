title: "About me"
---

My name is Jiří Šedý and I have been working in IT for more than ten years. I focus on monitoring, which includes collecting, processing and evaluating metrics, visualizing data and setting up alerting systems. My work covers the entire process from designing monitoring architectures to reacting to incidents. I work daily with tools such as Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager, which form the foundation of every well-functioning system.

My specialization is building stable, transparent and efficient monitoring solutions for both large and small infrastructures. I believe that the real value is not only in collecting data but mainly in understanding what the data means and how to respond to it. Thanks to this approach I help the company where I have worked for over a decade to optimize and automate operational processes so that systems run reliably and intelligently.

A significant part of my work involves **incident management**. I focus on ensuring that the right information reaches the right people as quickly as possible. I have experience with tools such as PagerDuty, Opsgenie and other platforms that help simplify and streamline the process.

Besides monitoring I enjoy **automation and infrastructure as code (IaC)**. I use Terraform to manage environments, CI/CD pipelines for deployment and configuration tools that keep everything consistent. Most of my work takes place in an on-premise cloud environment, but I also have experience with AWS where I maintain a distributed external monitoring system that operates across several regions.

### FPV drones and creative work

I completed an FPV drone building course with **DronPro**, where I learned what it means to build a drone from scratch. I went through everything from soldering and configuration to the first successful flight. Since then I have continued to train in FPV simulators, refining my control and precision and learning how to improve the flow and aesthetics of my shots.

At the moment I fly with a **DJI Avata 2**, which has become my main filming companion. I share my footage on social media and I am gradually building a portfolio that combines my passion for drones with technical precision. Every flight is an experience that teaches me something new and moves me forward.

I enjoy both **indoor and outdoor flights**. I like capturing the atmosphere of cafés, offices and other spaces that look completely different through FPV. I also enjoy exploring nature and open spaces during outdoor flights.

### How I work

I like to learn new things, analyze, experiment and improve what already works. In my professional life I am systematic, but in creative work I leave room for intuition. This combination allows me to connect the precision of an engineer with the creativity of a maker.
