## How it works
At the moment, I offer **FPV footage sessions free of charge**, as long as I can use the results in my portfolio.
I’m mainly looking for collaborations where I can explore different environments, types of spaces, and scenarios.

If you already have a specific request for a commercial output, we can discuss an **individual rate** based on complexity and time on site.

For flights in protected landscape areas or nature reserves, I need to know the shooting date in advance so that I can arrange the required permissions for flying in those zones.
